## Hi there, I'm Rem

I'm a developer mainly working with Lua and HTML. I focus a lot on backend systems and making sure things are built in a way that wont become a problem later. I'm comfortable building full systems from scratch, refactoring messy or fragile code and restructuring projects so they dont fall apart once new features get added. 
(Garry's Mod taught me this the hard way)

Most of my work is around systems design. Stuff like data flow, client/server logic, progression systems, permissions and other backend heavy features. I also do front end scripting when needed, especially UI logic and how it talks to backend systems etc.

I code in a way that's clear structure, readable code and room to expand later. I avoid overengineering not because its hard but because it usually creates more problems than it solves. Most of the time it just ends up being a temporary solution anyway.

I work best with people who communicate clearly, know what they want and respect timelines. Pricing is always fair and based on effort. Simple work stays simple and complex work is treated properly.

I usually take on one off commissions or repeat work with people I enjoy working with. I dont rush projects or give out half-finished systems. If I take something on, it's done properly and in a way that's easy to maintain later.

This Git of mine is mainly here to show how I structure my code, the kinds of systems I build and how I approach development overall.
